# Geometry Dash Diamond: Emerald Edition

Geometry Dash Diamond: Emerald Edition (GDDEE for short) is a Geometry Dash clone/recreation/fangame made in Godot. It intends on recreating the rhythm-based platformer Geometry Dash as closely as possible while still keeping it distinct from the real game. also it will have a native linux build this is very important because the real gd doesnt
## Questions some people could have but idk actually

### What does the "Emerald Edition" part mean?
Geometry Dash Diamond was a GD fangame I was making in Scratch a while ago before I gave up and then decided to remake it. The first remake, named Geometry Dash Diamond: Recoded, was being made in Turbowarp (scratch mod) before being lost due to me having to reinstall linux and forgetting to back it up somewhere. GDDEE is the second remake, being made in Godot instead of Scratch.
### Why Godot?
because i felt like it also i wanted to learn something other than scratch
##
i love gd cologne
